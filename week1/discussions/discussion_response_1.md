Response:

Cool choice with the ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Dual White OC 8GB Graphics Card... ASUS is a good brand for motherboards from what I've read.

Ram is a good choice, but I would recommend getting 2x 32GB sticks instead of 2x 16GB sticks at the same speed. Price is about the same. 

Good choice with the motherboard - MSI and Wifi 7 are good choices.

Cool choice with the CPU, though the Ryzen 7 series is slower ddr4 memory... so you would have to swap your ram choice. Plus the 7700X is a bit old. The Ryzen 9 9900X series is a good choice and is compatible with ddr5 memory and supports error correcting code!

Good choice with the cooler though AMD recommends liquid cooling for all of their CPU's
Good choice with the case - 2500D AIRFLOW Mid-Tower Dual Chamber PC Case - White. The "Airflow" sounds like it would be good for cooling without the hassel of liquid cooling maintence. 

Plenty of power with the HXi Series™ HX1500i Fully Modular Ultra-Low Noise Platinum ATX 1500 Watt PC Power Supply.

Good choice with the storage drives - P13237-001 HP 1.92TB 2.5" SAS 12G RI M2 SSD.

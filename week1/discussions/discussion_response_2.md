My group and I were going for a computer that was going to be all around well put together in a way such that it could be used for anything we wanted to use it for. On top of being able perform really well, we wanted a computer that didn't have any RGB. We wanted this just for the aesthetics. We chose our CPU because of it's high clock speed and decent number of cores that would be sufficient for anything that we would be doing day to day. The CPU cooler was the largest our case would support so that we could be as effective as possible with our cooling. For storage, we went with 2 NVME SSDs for fast read and write speeds in small spaces. For RAM, we decided we didn't need to go much higher than 64GBs as most of the day to day stuff we were doing was going to be fine. For our power supply, we went with a really powerful unit in order to ensure that we could upgrade our computer down the line in case new parts require more power than was being used. Our case that we chose went with the no RGB design and came with fans to match. On top of that, the case was selected to fit all of our components.

Great choices! 
I definitely agree with the lack of RGB lighting. It's distracting potentially... The Asus 4090 is a great choice for a GPU at 24gb as well as the rest of the components overall.

One thing is that while it would be a good choice for a high end gaming computer, though for a workstation I would recommend an error correcting code compatible GPU considering the Ryzen 9 series with a compatible CPU typically supports ECC.

This is protecting the 'bit manipulation' and woudln't be much of a difference in changes to the build to get this.

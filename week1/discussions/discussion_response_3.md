This computer is intended for training high level AI models though deep learning. The high core count on our CPU and GDDR6 in the GPU will mesh seamlessly to handle large datasets and train models efficiently. Our main concerns while putting this build together was the power requirements and high latency with the ram. We remedied these problems by choosing a power supply with 2200 W as our current build is estimated to run at 938 W. This may be seen as overkill, but our motherboard has a lot of room to expand if desired. With our motherboard we could be running four total GPU's, putting our estimated total wattage at 1838 W. We remedied the latency problem by choosing sticks with a good balance between speed and storage.

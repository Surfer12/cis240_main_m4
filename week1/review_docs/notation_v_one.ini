Below is a self-contained resource clarifying the key mathematical notation and concepts presented in these last two pages. The focus is on:
	1.	Base (radix) notation (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal)
	2.	Polynomial expansions (how to interpret numbers in base )
	3.	Subscript or prefix conventions (e.g., “0b1010” vs. “1010₂”)
	4.	Conversion algorithms (decimal to another base, or from one base to another)

Each section provides an explanation of the notation, why it is used, and practical examples to solidify your understanding.

	1.	Base/Positional Notation Basics
	•	Key Concept: A number in base  can be seen as a sequence of digits  where each digit is multiplied by a corresponding power of  depending on its position.
	•	Notation:
	•	often denotes a value in base .
	•	Digits in base  might be written as .
	•	For instance,  in binary means:
￼
	2.	Polynomial Representation (Equation 2.4/2.5 References)
	•	Equation 2.4:
￼
	•	Here,  is the digit in the th position, and  is the integer value of that digit symbol.
	•	ranges from 0 to . For example, in base 2, valid digits are 0 or 1; in base 16, valid digits range from 0 to 9, then A to F.
	•	Equation 2.5 (specific to base 2):
￼
	•	Interpretation: The number is essentially a polynomial in . Each digit is a coefficient of a power of .
	3.	Symbol Sets for Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal (Table 2.1)
	•	Binary (base 2) uses: 0, 1.
	•	Octal (base 8) uses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
	•	Decimal (base 10) uses: 0–9.
	•	Hexadecimal (base 16) uses: 0–9 plus A–F (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15).
Examples:
	•	in decimal is  in hex.
	•	in binary is  in decimal.
	4.	Subscripts, Prefixes, and Suffixes
	•	Subscript Notation:
	•	means “the number 11 in base 2.”
	•	means “the number 11 in base 10.”
	•	means “the number 11 in base 16.”
	•	Programming Language Prefixes (e.g., C):
	•	0b1010 (binary)
	•	010 (octal)
	•	0x10 (hexadecimal)
	•	“No prefix” typically implies decimal.
This helps programmers quickly identify the base used in code.
	5.	Converting Between Bases (Equation 2.6, 2.7, etc.)
	•	General Method:
	•	Decimal → Another Base: Repeatedly divide the decimal number by the new base , track remainders, and read the digits in reverse order.
	•	Another Base → Decimal: Expand the number as a polynomial (per Equation 2.4) or sum up digit × base^position.
	•	Example: Converting 26 to hexadecimal (Algorithm 2 example):
	1.	(quotient=1, remainder=10) → remainder “10” in decimal is “A” in hex.
	2.	(quotient=0, remainder=1) → digit “1.”
	•	Reading from last to first = “1A.”
	•	Equation 2.8: Illustrates how each hex digit can be mapped to 4 bits in binary, and vice versa.
	•	Equation 2.9: Shows a large binary number  being represented as . The point is that each nibble (4 bits) directly translates to one hex digit.
	6.	Unsigned Numbers on Computers
	•	If you have  bits, the representable range is . (e.g., 8 bits can represent .)
	•	Equation 2.10:  with 32 bits. You see it written in full 32-bit form with leading zeros.
	•	Equation 2.11:  with 32 bits for the maximum 32-bit unsigned integer.
	7.	Practical Insights
	1.	Keep track of digits: In base 2 (binary), you only have 0/1; in base 16, you might see “A,” “B,” etc. mapping to decimal values 10, 11, etc.
	2.	Leading zeros: They often appear in diagrams to show that you’re using a fixed number of bits (e.g., a 32-bit word). They don’t change the value but matter in hardware contexts.
	3.	Hex and Binary: A handy rule is that 1 hex digit ↔ 4 binary digits. This makes it easy to convert between the two without going through decimal.
	8.	Quick Reference: Common Equations & Meanings
	•	Number in base b:
￼
	•	Decimal to base b:
	•	Repeated division by  (or repeated “subtract the largest power of ” for the integer part, and repeated multiply-by-2 or by  for the fraction part).
	•	base b to decimal:
	•	Evaluate each digit times powers of .
Notation Clarification:
	•	is the base, an integer ≥ 2.
	•	is the digit in position . (Highest position is  .)
	•	means “the integer value of the digit symbol.” For instance, if  is “A,” then  in base 16 is 10 in decimal.

How to Use This Resource:
	•	Step 1: Identify which base(s) you’re dealing with (2, 8, 10, 16).
	•	Step 2: Check the symbol-value (like “A” → 10) if working with hexadecimal.
	•	Step 3: Apply the polynomial form (Equation 2.4/2.5) or the repeated division/multiplication method to convert.
	•	Step 4: Remember the subscript or prefix that indicates the number’s base, so you don’t confuse  (eleven in decimal) with  (three in decimal).

With these notations and clarifications in mind, you’ll be able to interpret any example from the text—whether it’s a big binary number (like 1011010012), a hex number (like A3F16), or an octal representation. This knowledge is crucial for understanding how compilers, debuggers, and hardware design documentation specify numbers in various bases.

<closing_remarks>
Use this guide as a reference sheet while reading through the examples in your text or practicing conversions yourself. By familiarizing yourself with the notation (subscripts, polynomial expansions, symbol sets) and practicing base conversions, you’ll quickly gain fluency in interpreting and manipulating numbers in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal forms.

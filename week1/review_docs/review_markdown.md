## Analysis Layer: Core Concepts of Number Base Notation

{{ This section sets the stage by outlining the fundamental concepts that will be covered in this review. It mirrors the `<analysis_layer>` in `notation_v_one.lua` by establishing the scope and objectives of the document. }}

This review focuses on the following key aspects of number base notation:

1.  **Base (Radix) Notation:** Understanding the concept of different number bases (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) and their significance in computing.
2.  **Polynomial Expansions:**  Learning how to interpret numbers in different bases using polynomial expansions, which is crucial for base conversion and understanding positional value.
3.  **Notation Conventions:** Clarifying subscript and prefix conventions used to denote different bases (e.g., $0b1010$, $1010_2$) in both mathematical and programming contexts.
4.  **Conversion Algorithms:**  Reviewing the algorithms for converting numbers between different bases, particularly between decimal and other bases, and between binary and hexadecimal.

Each section below will provide explanations, mathematical notation using LaTeX, and examples to reinforce your understanding of these concepts.

## Resource Outline: Detailed Breakdown of Number Base Concepts

{{ This section corresponds to the `<resource_outline>` in `notation_v_one.lua`. It provides a structured, point-by-point breakdown of the key concepts, using LaTeX for mathematical expressions and examples to illustrate each point. }}

### 1. Base/Positional Notation Basics

**Key Concept:** In positional notation, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number. Each position represents a power of the base.

**Notation:**
- $ (d_{m-1}d_{m-2}\ldots d_1d_0)_b $ denotes a number in base $b$.
- $ d_i $ represents the digit at position $i$.
- Digits in base $b$ range from $0$ to $b-1$.

**Example (Binary):**
The binary number $ (1010)_2 $ can be expanded as:

$$ (1010)_2 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10_{10} $$

Thus, $ (1010)_2 $ is equivalent to $ 10 $ in decimal.

### 2. Polynomial Representation (Equations 2.4 & 2.5)

**Equation 2.4 (General Base $b$):**

$$ \text{value}((d_{m-1}d_{m-2}\ldots d_1d_0)_b) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (\text{symbol\_value}(d_i)) \times b^i $$

- $ d_i $ is the digit at the $i^{th}$ position (from right to left, starting at $i=0$).
- $ \text{symbol\_value}(d_i) $ is the integer value of the digit symbol $d_i$.
- $ b $ is the base.

**Equation 2.5 (Base 2 Specific):**

$$ \text{value}((d_{m-1}d_{m-2}\ldots d_1d_0)_2) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (\text{symbol\_value}(d_i)) \times 2^i $$

**Interpretation:**  A number in any base is a polynomial in terms of the base $b$. Each digit is a coefficient of a power of $b$.

### 3. Symbol Sets for Common Bases (Table 2.1)

- **Binary (Base 2):** Symbols: $ \{0, 1\} $
- **Octal (Base 8):** Symbols: $ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} $
- **Decimal (Base 10):** Symbols: $ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} $
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Symbols: $ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F\} $ (where $A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15$)

**Examples:**
- $ (26)_{10} $ in hexadecimal is $ (1A)_{16} $.
- $ (1010)_2 $ in decimal is $ (10)_{10} $.

### 4. Subscripts, Prefixes, and Suffixes

- **Subscript Notation:**
    - $ 11_2 $ means "number 11 in base 2".
    - $ 11_{10} $ means "number 11 in base 10".
    - $ 11_{16} $ means "number 11 in base 16".

- **Programming Language Prefixes (e.g., C):**
    - `0b1010` (binary)
    - `010` (octal)
    - `0x10` (hexadecimal)
    - No prefix typically implies decimal.

### 5. Converting Between Bases (Equations 2.6, 2.7, etc.)

**General Methods:**

- **Decimal to Base $b$:** Repeatedly divide the decimal number by $b$, record the remainders, and read them in reverse order.
- **Base $b$ to Decimal:** Use polynomial expansion (Equation 2.4) or sum up digit Ã— base<sup>position</sup>.

**Example: Converting 26 (decimal) to hexadecimal:**

1.  $ 26 \div 16 = 1 $ with remainder $ 10 $ (which is 'A' in hex).
2.  $ 1 \div 16 = 0 $ with remainder $ 1 $.

Reading remainders in reverse order: $ (1A)_{16} $.

**Equation 2.8 & 2.9:**  Illustrate the direct mapping between hexadecimal digits and 4-bit binary numbers, simplifying conversions between these two bases.

### 6. Unsigned Numbers on Computers

- With $n$ bits, the representable range for unsigned numbers is $ 0 $ to $ 2^n - 1 $.
    - For example, 8 bits can represent $ 0 $ to $ 2^8 - 1 = 255 $.

**Equations 2.10 & 2.11:** Show examples of 32-bit unsigned numbers, demonstrating the range and representation in binary and hexadecimal.

### 7. Practical Insights

1.  **Digit Tracking:** Be mindful of the valid digits for each base (e.g., 0-1 in binary, 0-F in hexadecimal).
2.  **Leading Zeros:** Often used to indicate a fixed number of bits (e.g., 32-bit word) but do not change the numerical value.
3.  **Hex and Binary Relationship:**  1 hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits, simplifying conversions.

### 8. Quick Reference: Common Equations & Meanings

- **Number in base $b$:**
    $$ (d_{m-1} d_{m-2} \ldots d_1 d_0)_b \rightarrow \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (\text{symbol\_value}(d_i)) \cdot b^i $$

- **Decimal to base $b$:** Repeated division by $b$ and collecting remainders.

- **Base $b$ to decimal:** Polynomial expansion (sum of digits times powers of $b$).

**Notation Clarifications:**
- $ b $: Base (radix), integer $ \geq 2 $.
- $ d_i $: Digit at position $ i $.
- $ \text{symbol\_value}(d_i) $: Decimal value of digit symbol $ d_i $.

Handling Negative Values in a Microarchitecture Context
	1.	Two’s Complement Is the Norm
	•	In practical CPU and hardware implementations, two’s complement is nearly universal for representing negative integers. Rather than storing a separate sign bit (sign-magnitude) or prepending a minus sign (as in a human-readable form), the negative number’s bits themselves are transformed:
	1.	Take the binary representation of the positive value.
	2.	Invert the bits (flip 0s to 1s and vice versa).
	3.	Add 1 to the inverted bits.
	•	This system simplifies arithmetic logic, ensuring addition and subtraction work uniformly for positive and negative numbers.
	2.	Sign-Magnitude vs. Two’s Complement
	•	Sign-magnitude: For demonstration or conceptual clarity, you might convert a number like -11.25 to binary by taking its absolute value (11.25 → 1011.01) and then adding a “-” sign: -1011.01. This is easy to understand for human-readable output, but not how hardware typically stores negative values.
	•	Two’s complement: Hardware representation would store -11.25 (if floating-point, typically using IEEE 754, or if fixed-point, using an integer-based two’s complement approach) in a fully binary-compatible form without a separate textual “-” sign.
	3.	Integrating Negative Conversion into Code
	•	If you were writing a function to generate hardware-accurate two’s complement for integers, you would:
	1.	Check if the integer is negative.
	2.	Convert the absolute value to binary.
	3.	Invert the bits.
	4.	Add 1 to form the two’s complement result.
	•	For floating-point numbers in actual CPU implementations, the sign is handled by a separate sign bit, while the fraction and exponent follow the IEEE 754 format. This goes well beyond simple sign-magnitude strings.
	4.	Implications for Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
	•	When writing or analyzing assembly instructions (such as ADD, SUB, or MOV), remember that the processor expects two’s complement for integer arithmetic. Understanding how negative values are physically stored will clarify why certain instructions behave the way they do.
	•	Sign extensions, overflow handling, and arithmetic carry bits all rely on two’s complement conventions.
	5.	Consistency & Round-Trip
	•	If you’re simply printing binaries for demonstration or user-facing logs, adding/removing a “-” sign is a quick way to display negativity. However, to remain consistent with actual machine-level representation, you’d convert negative numbers into their two’s complement form before displaying or storing them at the hardware level.
	•	This difference means that if you manually parse or reconstruct values from raw two’s complement bits, you need to invert-and-add-one (or otherwise interpret them as two’s complement) to get the original signed decimal value back.

Summary
	•	In a microarchitecture classroom setting, always keep in mind that hardware uses two’s complement for signed integers. The simple “negative sign + magnitude” approach (sign-magnitude) is not how processors physically represent negative values in memory.
	•	For floating-point numbers, hardware generally uses IEEE 754 standards, which incorporate a dedicated sign bit along with exponent and fraction fields.
	•	The “human-readable” examples in code demos can be helpful for clarity, but if you are asked for “true” binary representation at the machine level, two’s complement (for integers) or IEEE 754 (for floats) is the canonical method.
